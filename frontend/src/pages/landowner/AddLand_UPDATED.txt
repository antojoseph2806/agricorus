The AddLand.tsx file is too complex to update via string replacement. 

Key changes needed:
1. Change background from dark gradient to bg-gray-50
2. Change all cards from bg-white/5 to bg-white with border-gray-200
3. Change all text from text-white/text-gray-300 to text-gray-900/text-gray-600
4. Change all inputs from bg-white/10 to bg-white with border-gray-300
5. Change focus colors from red to emerald-500
6. Change buttons from red gradient to bg-emerald-600
7. Update all status badges to light backgrounds

The file has similar structure to EditLand.tsx which was already updated successfully.
Please manually apply the same design pattern used in EditLand.tsx to AddLand.tsx.
